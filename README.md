# CS Behaviours Page

- Do you struggle to write Civil Service Behaviours?
- Do you find it difficult to flip thought all the different documents?
- Want something easy to refernce when writing objectives?

This is static web page that brings together all of the key documents you need when you are writing Behaviours based statements.
I made this page to help me as I struggled with problems above and I hoping it can help others.

## Future Goals
- Make Sure it is Accessible!!!!! 
- Ensure that site is responsive to be able to view on mobile, tablet and web devices.
- Nav Bar, especally for mobile
- Add specialist Frameworks like DDaT, Commercial and Project Delivery.
- Add function at top to hide or view certain boxes
- Integrate in to my main site and then use Hexo to generate the page using MD tables or CSV files
- Re-Desgin in line with GDS style Guide
- Meet Accessability Requirements
