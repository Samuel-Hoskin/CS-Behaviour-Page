# CS Behaviours Page

- Do you struggle to write Civil Service Behaviours?
- Do you find it difficult to flip thought all the different documents?

This is static web page that brings together all of the key documents you need when you are writing Behaviours based statements.
I made this page to help me as I struggled with problems above and I hoping it can help others.

## Future Goals
- Ensure that site is responsive to be able to view on mobile, tablet and web devices.
- Add specialist Frameworks like DDaT, Commercial and Project Delivery.
- Add function at top to hide or view certain boxes
- Integrate in to my main site and then use Hexo to generate the page using MD tables or CSV files
