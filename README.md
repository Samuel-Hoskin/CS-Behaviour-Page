# CS Behaviours Page

- Do you stuggle to write Civil Service Behaviours?
- Do you find it difficult to flip thought all the different documents?

This is static web page that brings togetter all of the key documents you need when you are writeing behaviour based statements.
I made this page to help me as as I stuggled with problems above and I hoping it can help others.

## Future Goals
- Ensure that site is responsive to be able to view on mobile, tablet and web devices.
- Add specalist Frameworks like DDaT, Commercail and Project Delivery.
- add funtion at top to hide or view certain boxes
- Intergrate in to my main site and then use Hexo to generate the page using MD tables or CSV files
