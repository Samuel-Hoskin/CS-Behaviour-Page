    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Leadership in Action</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body"> Every day we see the best Civil Service leaders...</p>

    <div class="flex">
        <div class="LiABox govuk-grid-column-one-half">
            <div class="LiA-Green">

            </div>
            <p class="govuk-body">Civil Service leaders set a vision, 
understand the purpose of their work and are focused on results and what
 this means for the citizen, in the UK or abroad. They put the mission 
and the goals of the organisation and wider system ahead of 
self-interest. As well as focusing on delivery and the here and now, 
leaders take a longer term view and help others to also keep this in 
mind when making decisions. To achieve the best outcomes, leaders think 
about how a team can be at its best, building personal and staff 
resilience to support wellbeing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="LiABox govuk-grid-column-one-half">

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Building inclusive teams and encouraging challenge</h3>
            </div>
            <p class="govuk-body">Civil Service leaders value and 
actively promote inclusion. They recognise that diversity â€“ of 
background, of life experience and of thought â€“ brings different 
insights, creates challenge and encourages change and innovation. 
Leaders create conditions of safety where all colleagues can provide 
challenge and feedback. They surface tensions and resolve ambiguities 
and speak up when they experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, 
discrimination, bullying or harassment. They value fairness and respect,
 share a sense of connectedness and create a sense of belonging for 
others.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="govuk-body">Civil Service leaders show pride and 
passion for public service - the work that they do drives them to want 
to do better and to seek out new solutions to challenges every day. They
 continually reflect on the values that underpin their work and that 
drive them to work to serve citizens, sharing this with others. They are
 ambitious about the changes they, their teams and colleagues can make 
for citizens. This includes leading new and different ways of carrying 
out tasks, innovating and transforming how we work.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="govuk-body">Civil Service leaders continually 
think about and take action to develop others and, build their 
capability and continually improve their performance. Leaders make the 
time and space to build the teams that are needed to achieve their 
goals. They make it possible for others to do their best work and have 
ownership of it. They help individuals to set their own objectives and 
make decisions on how and where they work. The best Civil Service 
leaders also continuously practice their active listening, coaching and 
communication skills to achieve this.</p>

            <div class="LiA-Red">

            </div>
            <p class="govuk-body">Civil Service leaders are rigorous in 
their decision making, using the best available evidence and wide range 
of expertise to underpin what they do. They exercise their judgement to 
make sure their advice is incisive and decisions are fair. They know 
when and how to bring in technical skills and different perspectives to 
inform debate. They know when it is useful to keep a broader, strategic 
perspective and when to get â€˜into the detailâ€™ to really understand a 
situation or problem. They provide challenge and hold others to account.
 In all their decisions, they are focused on value for money, efficiency
 and sound financial management.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="govuk-body">Civil Service leaders have the 
experience needed to build and develop the right organisational 
structure and team to deliver against priorities, now and in the future.
 Leaders look across their teams to think about what they can learn and 
to identify what change they might bring. They understand how to 
implement effective governance and risk arrangements. They demonstrate a
 commitment to learning and professional development and throughout 
their career continue to consider the breadth and depth of experience 
they require to lead.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="govuk-body">Civil Service leaders recognise that 
many of the governmentâ€™s biggest challenges do not fit neatly into the 
boundaries of a single department, organisation or sector and work with 
others to identify shared solutions to challenges across systems. They 
encourage a broad range of people to work together to develop a shared 
view of a problem and to prioritise delivering the best outcomes for the
 citizen over narrower team or department objectives. They step out of 
the way to allow their teams to be innovative and take risks, 
identifying different ways of approaching and solving problems.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="govuk-body">Civil Service leaders are at their 
best when they are authentic and self-aware. They reflect on their 
actions and their emotions in different situations, show an openness to 
feedback and willingness to change, sharing reflections with their team.
 In doing this, they show their teams and peers that they are learning, 
make mistakes and learn from them, and can be vulnerable. Leaders commit
 to understanding how it feels in different roles, including for those 
delivering services direct to citizens. They regularly consider their 
own strengths and development areas, and have a personal development 
plan, using coaching and/or mentoring to support growth.</p>

                These Fast Streamersâ€™ outcomes have a positive, lasting

                They role model inclusive behaviour; working

                There is an expectation that behaviours are inclusive 
and they work collaboratively, building support and mutual trust, They 
should be communicating with pride and passion for their departments and
 the Civil Service, and they should be taking accountability for their 
work. A person who is marked â€˜partially metâ€™ is not delivering on all of
 these and must work with their Cohort Leader on a suitable development 
plan.
                Fast Streamers here are not proactive in identifying 
areas for development and are reluctant to move outside of their comfort
 zone. They may also require more supervision or support than expected. 
They fail to adapt to change, showing little resilience when faced with 
challenges. They demonstrate a lack of engagement with the FS scheme and
 processes, including a lack of enthusiasm for the corporate objective.
