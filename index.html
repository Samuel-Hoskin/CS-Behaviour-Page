They put the mission and the goals of the organisation and wider system ahead of self-interest. As well as focusing on delivery and the here and now, leaders take a longer term view and help others to also keep this in mind when making decisions. To achieve the best outcomes, leaders think about how a team can be at its best, building personal and staff resilience to support wellbeing.</p>

They recognise that diversity – of background, of life experience and of thought – brings different insights, creates challenge and encourages change and innovation. Leaders create conditions of safety where all colleagues can provide challenge and feedback. They surface tensions and resolve ambiguities and speak up when they experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, discrimination, bullying or harassment. They value fairness and respect, share a sense of connectedness and create a sense of belonging for others.</p>

They continually reflect on the values that underpin their work and that drive them to work to serve citizens, sharing this with others. They are ambitious about the changes they, their teams and colleagues can make for citizens. This includes leading new and different ways of carrying out tasks, innovating and transforming how we work.</p>

Leaders make the time and space to build the teams that are needed to achieve their goals. They make it possible for others to do their best work and have ownership of it. They help individuals to set their own objectives and make decisions on how and where they work. The best Civil Service leaders also continuously practice their active listening, coaching and communication skills to achieve this.</p>

                        <h3>Exercising judgement and making good evidence-based decisions</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p class="boxcontent">Civil Service leaders are rigorous in their decision making, using the best available evidence and wide range of expertise to underpin what they do. They exercise their judgement to make sure their advice is incisive and decisions are fair. They know when and how to bring in technical skills and different perspectives to inform debate. They know when it is useful to keep a broader, strategic perspective and when to get ‘into the detail’ to really understand a situation or problem. They provide challenge and hold others to account. In all their decisions, they are focused on value for money, efficiency and sound financial management.</p>

                    <p class="boxcontent">Civil Service leaders have the experience needed to build and develop the right organisational structure and team to deliver against priorities, now and in the future. Leaders look across their teams to think about what they can learn and to identify what change they might bring. They understand how to implement effective governance and risk arrangements. They demonstrate a commitment to learning and professional development and throughout their career continue to consider the breadth and depth of experience they require to lead.</p>

                    <p class="boxcontent">Civil Service leaders recognise that many of the government’s biggest challenges do not fit neatly into the boundaries of a single department, organisation or sector and work with others to identify shared solutions to challenges across systems. They encourage a broad range of people to work together to develop a shared view of a problem and to prioritise delivering the best outcomes for the citizen over narrower team or department objectives. They step out of the way to allow their teams to be innovative and take risks, identifying different ways of approaching and solving problems.</p>

                    <p class="boxcontent">Civil Service leaders are at their best when they are authentic and self-aware. They reflect on their actions and their emotions in different situations, show an openness to feedback and willingness to change, sharing reflections with their team. In doing this, they show their teams and peers that they are learning, make mistakes and learn from them, and can be vulnerable. Leaders commit to understanding how it feels in different roles, including for those delivering services direct to citizens. They regularly consider their own strengths and development areas, and have a personal development plan, using coaching and/or mentoring to support growth.</p>

                <p class="boxcontent">This person has met some but not all objectives and/or Fast Stream Success Criteria expected in this posting. This may be either in terms of the ‘what’, the ‘how’ or both.
                    There is an expectation that behaviours are inclusive and they work collaboratively, building support and mutual trust, They should be communicating with pride and passion for their departments and the Civil Service, and they should be taking accountability for their work. A person who is marked ‘partially met’ is not delivering on all of these and must work with their Cohort Leader on a suitable development plan.
                    Fast Streamers here are not proactive in identifying areas for development and are reluctant to move outside of their comfort zone. They may also require more supervision or support than expected. They fail to adapt to change, showing little resilience when faced with challenges. They demonstrate a lack of engagement with the FS scheme and processes, including a lack of enthusiasm for the corporate objective.
